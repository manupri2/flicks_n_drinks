2,121,Jon Morales,,San Francisco,5,"*Pineapple Gomme: 
Mix equal parts (1.5 cups) gum arabic with water over high heat until it all mixes and then let cool for a bit. Then you're gonna make a sugar syrup with 2 parts sugar, 1 part water (4 cups water, 2 cups white granulated sugar) in the same manner over high heat until it mixes, and then add the gum syrup to the mix until everything dissolves and what you're left with is a thick gummy syrup that resembles a whole lot of baby batter. Then cut up 1.5 cups of pineapple chunks, put in mason jar, and pour the gum syrup over it and let it sit in the refrigerator over night. A few hours would work also if you don't have that much time. However, the more time, the more pineapple infusion takes place. When it's ready, strain into another mason jar or bottle, and it's ready to go.",0,0
